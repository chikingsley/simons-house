Couchsurfing changes peoples’ lives. Hearing the stories of Couchsurfers whose lives have been transformed by travel is the greatest reward for doing what we do. Join us and every day thousands of people from every country in the world will meet in person as a direct result of your work.

Couchsurfing was founded in 2004 by a small group of travel and cultural exchange enthusiasts determined to change the world by providing greater access to the kinds of meaningful travel experiences that depend on connecting with people. It grew rapidly and converted to a mission-driven, for-profit corporation in 2011.

Couchsurfing is the world’s premier social travel platform, with over 14 million members in every country in the world. Couchsurfing is backed by Benchmark, Menlo Ventures, General Catalyst and the Omidyar Network.

We are a small, nimble and hyper-focused team who have built the next generation of this powerful service, with a strong focus on mobile. If you enjoy working on a product that’s easy to love for an extremely passionate member community, you’d like it here.
