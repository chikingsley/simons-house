Markdown Content:
Couchsurfing is a global network of over 11 million travelers, adventure seekers and lifelong learners in over 150,000 cities in every country in the world.

Our free service connects travelers across the globe who share experiences ranging from hosting one another in their homes to having a beer to becoming close friends and travel companions.

Hotels and tour companies can give you a bed or a guide, but meeting locals will make your trip truly memorable and meaningful.

We’d love to tell you more. Please email us at [media@couchsurfing.com](mailto:media@couchsurfing.com) to request information.
